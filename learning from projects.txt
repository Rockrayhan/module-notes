============== AI ==================
* Use AI with a learning mindset – Question its answers instead of blindly copying them.
* Engage in discussions – Join communities where deeper technical debates happen.
* Improve code reviews – Focus on why a solution was chosen, not just if it works.
* Build things from scratch – Gain hands-on experience before letting AI automate everything.


=============== Final Touch ==============
1. google lighthouse for optimization
 * optimize images -> compress , use webp 

2. responsiveness for all devices, mobile based text alighnment, line height, p size, img size, footer reshape.



============= GoClova  ===========

# React Router does not automatically scroll to the top when navigating between pages. You need to manually handle scrolling using useEffect.
=> so I created scrollToTop component


# after hosting when go to a page and refresh it shows  
404 Not Found
nginx

=>  I used this code in vhost in cloudpanel  

location / {
 try_files $uri /index.html;
}
